# Implementation of CAN Bus Interface for a Multipurpose Board

Abstract - 
In a modern automotive system, thereâ€™s a minimum of 30+ Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and a few luxury vehicles claim to have 90+ ECUs. Hence, there is rapid growth for communications between all these ECUs which is crucial for the overall implementation of the vehicle's features. This thesis will give a brief on the real-time In-Vehicle Communication protocols like Local Interconnected Network, FlexRay, and Controller Area Network. Then, will give a extensive information about CAN, followed with how to set up communication network using CAN. 
Even though, this thesis talks only about the implementation on CAN in a car, CAN is actually being used in railways, aircrafts, telescopes and in medical fields too.
